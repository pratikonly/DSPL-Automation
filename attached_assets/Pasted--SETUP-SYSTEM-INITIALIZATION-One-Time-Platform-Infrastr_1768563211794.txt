🔧 SETUP — SYSTEM INITIALIZATION
One-Time Platform Infrastructure Readiness

This phase is executed only once before the system becomes operational.
Its purpose is to ensure that all technical services, permissions, and templates are correctly configured so that later automation runs safely, reliably, and under full admin control.

1️⃣ Communication Infrastructure Configuration
1.1 SMTP Email System Setup

Purpose:
Enable automated, trackable, and authenticated email communication from the company’s official email address.

Details:

Configure SMTP credentials for a company-owned email account (example: hr@company.com)

Supported providers:

Google Workspace

Microsoft Outlook

Zoho Mail

Any custom SMTP server

Secure storage of credentials using environment variables (never hardcoded)

Capabilities Enabled:

Automated job notifications

Interview confirmation emails

Follow-up communication

Email delivery status tracking (sent / failed / bounced)

Operational Safeguards:

Rate limiting to prevent spam classification

Retry logic for temporary failures

Manual override option for admin

1.2 WhatsApp Business API Integration

Purpose:
Enable compliant, template-based WhatsApp messaging for candidate communication.

Details:

Integration via:

WhatsApp Business Cloud API

or verified providers (e.g., Twilio, Meta partners)

Phone number verification and business approval completed once

Webhook endpoint configured to receive incoming candidate replies

Template Configuration:

Pre-approved message templates such as:

Job interest confirmation

Interview schedule notification

Follow-up reminders

Templates are non-editable at runtime to comply with WhatsApp policies

Capabilities Enabled:

One-click bulk messaging

Candidate reply capture (YES / NO / custom text)

Real-time response status in admin dashboard

Compliance Note:

Messages are sent only after admin action

No unsolicited automation

2️⃣ AI Configuration & Prompt Engineering
2.1 AI Provider Configuration

Purpose:
Enable structured and consistent AI behavior across CV parsing and job matching.

Details:

AI provider API key configuration (e.g., OpenAI)

Model selection based on task:

Resume understanding

Skill extraction

Job matching explanation

Token and cost limits defined to prevent overuse

2.2 CV Parsing Prompt Engineering

Purpose:
Ensure AI extracts accurate, structured, and explainable data from resumes.

Prompt Design Principles:

AI instructed to:

Extract only what is explicitly present

Never assume or fabricate missing data

Return structured JSON only

Fields defined clearly:

Name

Phone number

Email

Education

Experience (role, duration)

Skills

Location

Age (only if explicitly mentioned)

Why This Matters:

Prevents hallucination

Makes AI output auditable

Allows admin trust in automation

2.3 Job Matching Logic Configuration

Purpose:
Prepare AI to recommend jobs without making final decisions.

Details:

Matching criteria weights defined:

Skill relevance

Experience range compatibility

Location preference

AI generates:

Match percentage

Human-readable explanation

Recommendations are advisory only

Admin approval is mandatory

3️⃣ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Purpose:
Ensure secure and controlled access to sensitive candidate and communication data.

Defined Roles:
3.1 Super Admin

Full system access

Configuration changes

API keys and integrations

User management

3.2 HR Admin

CV upload

Job assignment

Communication triggers

Interview scheduling

3.3 Viewer / Recruiter

Read-only access

Candidate profile viewing

No communication privileges

Security Measures:

Permission checks at API level

UI elements hidden based on role

Action logging per user

4️⃣ Job Post Template Indexing

Purpose:
Prepare structured job data so AI and admin workflows operate consistently.

Details:

Job posts created in advance with:

Title

Required skills

Experience range

Location

Job description

Each job post stored as structured data

Indexed for:

AI matching

Manual selection

Reporting

Benefits:

Faster assignment

Consistent communication

Better AI recommendations

5️⃣ System Validation & Readiness Check

Purpose:
Confirm that all components are operational before live usage.

Validation Checklist:

Test email sent successfully

Test WhatsApp template delivered

AI test CV parsed correctly

Job matching returns expected output

Role permissions enforced correctly

Result:

System marked as Ready

CV intake and automation unlocked
