🧠 CV INTELLIGENT INTAKE
Structured, Auditable, AI-Assisted Resume Understanding
1️⃣ Feature Objective

CV Intelligent Intake is responsible for converting unstructured resume files into structured, reliable candidate profiles that can be safely used in downstream automation.

This feature does not make decisions.
It prepares data so humans and automation can act confidently.

2️⃣ Input Sources
Supported CV Formats

PDF (text-based)

PDF (scanned images)

DOC / DOCX

Upload Modes

Single CV upload

Bulk CV upload (multiple files)

Each file is processed independently to prevent cross-contamination of data.

3️⃣ Intake Pipeline (High-Level Flow)

4️⃣ File Validation & Preprocessing
Purpose

Ensure that only valid and readable files enter the AI pipeline.

Operations

File type validation

File size limits

Corrupted file detection

Duplicate CV detection (hash-based)

Outcomes

Invalid files rejected with reason

Valid files queued for processing

5️⃣ Text Extraction Layer
5.1 Text-Based PDFs / DOCX

Method:

Native text extraction libraries

Layout-aware parsing to preserve structure

Extracted Content:

Headings

Bullet points

Employment sections

Education blocks

5.2 Scanned PDFs (OCR Path)

Triggered When:

No selectable text detected

Method:

OCR engine (e.g., Tesseract)

Language auto-detection

Noise reduction and text cleanup

Safeguards:

Confidence threshold checks

Low-quality scans flagged for review

6️⃣ AI Semantic Parsing
Purpose

Convert raw resume text into structured, machine-readable data without hallucination.

6.1 AI Input Design

AI receives:

Cleaned resume text

Explicit extraction instructions

Fixed output schema

AI is instructed to:

Extract only explicitly stated information

Leave fields empty if not present

Never infer age, experience, or skills

6.2 Structured Output Schema (Example)
{
  "name": "Amit Verma",
  "phone": "+91XXXXXXXXXX",
  "email": "amit@example.com",
  "education": [
    {
      "degree": "B.Tech",
      "field": "Computer Science",
      "institution": "ABC University"
    }
  ],
  "experience": [
    {
      "role": "Backend Developer",
      "company": "XYZ Pvt Ltd",
      "duration": "2 years"
    }
  ],
  "skills": ["Node.js", "PostgreSQL", "Docker"],
  "location": "Bangalore",
  "age": null
}

6.3 Explainability Layer

AI additionally returns:

Parsing confidence

Ambiguous sections detected

Notes for admin review

This ensures human trust in AI output.

7️⃣ Data Normalization & Cleaning
Purpose

Standardize extracted data for consistency across the platform.

Examples

Phone numbers normalized to international format

Skill names standardized (e.g., “JS” → “JavaScript”)

Experience durations converted into numeric ranges

No new information is added — only formatting improvements.

8️⃣ Candidate Profile Creation
What Is Created

A persistent candidate profile with:

Parsed structured data

Original CV file

Text extraction snapshot

AI output snapshot

Profile Characteristics

Human-readable UI

Editable by admin

AI data clearly marked

9️⃣ Duplicate & Identity Handling
Purpose

Avoid multiple profiles for the same candidate.

Detection Methods

Email match

Phone number match

CV content similarity

Admin Controls

Merge profiles

Ignore duplicates

Keep versions

🔟 Audit Logging & Traceability
What Is Logged

Upload timestamp

Admin user ID

AI model used

Prompt version

Parsed output

Why This Matters

Compliance

Debugging

AI accountability

Trust in automation

11️⃣ Error Handling & Fallbacks
AI Failure

CV marked as “Parsing Failed”

Admin notified

Manual review option

OCR Failure

Low confidence warning

Admin can re-upload or skip

Partial Extraction

Missing fields highlighted

Profile still created

12️⃣ Security & Privacy Controls

CV files stored securely

Access restricted via roles

No AI training on user data

Logs are immutable

13️⃣ Output of CV Intelligent Intake

After completion, the system produces:

A validated candidate profile

Structured, explainable data

Ready input for:

Job matching

Communication workflows

Interview scheduling

🔑 Key Principles Behind This Feature

AI assists, does not decide

No guessing, no hallucination

Human review always possible

Every action is traceable

Scales safely with volume
